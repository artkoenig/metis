# The plugin's SessionStart hook. It does two things a plugin cannot do by
# itself: it puts the rulebook text into the session's context — a CLAUDE.md
# at a plugin root is not loaded, and a skill is model-invoked and therefore
# optional — and it points the project's git hooks at the push guard shipped
# with the plugin.
#
# Skills and agents need nothing from here: plugin discovery exposes
# skills/<name>/SKILL.md and agents/<name>.md on its own. What this script
# adds for them is the self-check status, which counts what is actually
# reachable in the plugin tree, so a session sees an incomplete install
# instead of silently missing half the workflow.
#
# stdout carries the hook JSON and nothing else.
